        	<p>This website is a guide on how to prevent and fight different types of cyber harassment including cyberbullying, cyberstalking, revenge porn, and more with helpful resources for further information on these topics. This website also details the effects of cyber harassment on the harrassed and the harasser and includes stories of real cases and their outcomes. The design of this website is meant to make it a <strong>parody</strong> of <a href="https://kiwifarms.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kiwifarms.net</a>, a forum characterized in mainstream media as "the Webâ€™s biggest community of stalkers". All the information on this website is freely available on the public Web. <strong>Disclaimer: <u>This website was just a school project. The Kiwi Farms website is the model for this site because I wanted to test my coding skills in replicating a design and because I'm also interested in some of the topics people discuss on it. As on every website, only <em>some</em> individuals on Kiwi Farms are harassers. Obviously I do not condone harassing random people who use a website.</u></strong></p>
