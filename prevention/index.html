<h2>How do I prevent a cyber harasser from targeting me?</h2>

<p>There is no total guarantee that you can ever completely prevent somebody from targeting you because humans are innately social creatures and you need to interact with other human beings to live a happy life. There is nothing you can do to prevent someone from becoming your harasser because these feelings that prompt harassers to act out are beyond your control. However, you can always take steps to insure that the damage a potential harasser may do to you is minimized. This includes taking steps to prevent targeted attacks like doxxing, swatting, DDoS attacks, and sexual harassment and avoid negative confrontations online.</p>
