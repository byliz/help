excerpt: Damian Leonhardt, once known as "Jessi Slaughter" online, was only 11 years old when they became a "viral Internet meme" back in 2010. Everyone has seen the video where Jessi's father points at the camera and threatens to call "the cyberpolice" on the <em>4chan</em> trolls who were harassing Jessi for being "out of control" online and accusing Blood on the Dance Floor singer Dahvie Vanity of raping her. Her online harassment and sexual exploitation took a toll on her and contributed to her developing mental and physical ailments. To this day she is still being stalked online.
