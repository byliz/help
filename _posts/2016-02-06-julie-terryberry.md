excerpt: Julie Ayla Patricia Terryberry was a 19 year old woman from Ontario, Canada who became a target of members on <em>Kiwi Farms</em> who ridiculed her autism, ADHD, sex work, and personal relationships. She committed suicide on June 29, 2016. By then, her thread, which started in February of that same year, was over 200 pages long. She is allegedly the first recorded case of suicide as a result of cyberstalking from <em>Kiwi Farms</em> members. There is an article of her on the <em>Lolcow</em> wiki with a summary of the events and a link to her thread. Read it at your own peril <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190214020636/https://lolcow.wiki/wiki/Julie_Terryberry" target="_blank">here</a>.
