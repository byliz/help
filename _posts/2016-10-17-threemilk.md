excerpt: Agatha (who went by "Threemilk T" online) was an ASMR YouTuber and <em>Twitch</em> variety livestreamer who became the object of obsession for members of the <em>/r9k/ ROBOT9001</em> board on <em>4chan</em>. Although her growth may have been thanks to the attention from these members, she became a victim of cyberstalking, with anonymous users sharing photos of her in threads while making creepy sexual, homophobic, and anti-semetic comments. Overwhelmed by the pressure and harassment from stalkers, she deleted all of her social media and videos from her channel - which had amassed <a href="https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/threemilk.html" target="_blank">over 40k subscribers</a> - and disappeared from the public eye to pursue a college degree.
