excerpt: Alex (known as "YandereDev" online) is an indie game developer and former industry game programmer known for his <a href="https://yanderedev.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">work-in-progress</a> stealth action video game tentatively titled <a href="https://yanderesimulator.com/" target="_blank">Yandere Simulator</a>. At first his project was very well received by the <em>YouTube</em> gaming community when he started it in 2014 until the developer upset some fans and started receiving criticism about the length of his development despite working full-time on the game and receiving funds from <em>Patreon</em> supporters. Criticism morphed into targeted hate videos, death threats, and slanderous accusations of pedophilia on his social media. The fallout resulted in massive stress and further delaying of the game's completion.
